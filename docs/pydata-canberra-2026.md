## Embracing Analytic Turtles: What happens when 150 analysts tackle the same question and same data?

A common assumption is analytic workflow is a straight path from data to visualisation when the domain question is well scoped.

In this talk, Charles will share her current collaboration. Melbourne-based scientist Dr Hannah S. Fraser provided 150 ecological research teams with two well-scoped questions and accompanying smallish datasets with good coverage. This talk examines the submitted analyses.

Much is made of the forking paths of modelling choice. In this presentation we will see that it's forking paths of analytic turtles all the way down. The forks begin from choice of source column in which there is surprisingly little consensus!

Come for pizza, and stay for a lively discussion about the many turtle facets of analytical choice. 

**Dr Charles T. Gray** is a datapunk (variously applied mathematician, data scientist, data architect, analytics engineer, research software engineer) and reformed pianist who has wrangled analytic questions in scientific research, video games, neuromarketing, and telecommunications across the last 15 years in Europe and Australia.
