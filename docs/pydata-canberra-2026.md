## Embracing Analytic Turtles: What happens when 150 expert teams tackle the same question and same data?

In this talk, Charles will share insights from a project which challenges that assumption. Over 150 ecological research teams were provided with two well-scoped questions and accompanying smallish datasets of ecological field data with good coverage. Charles is applying [insert mathematical concepts, techniques here sorry I suck with names… graph theory?] to examine the different choices these research teams made. Her collaborator Hannah Fraser, designed the original experiment and keeps Charles tethered to the ecological context.
People speak of modelling choices as ‘forking paths’, but this analogy is too clean for describing the multitude of alternate choices uncovered. Instead, the more you look the more you see, essentially it’s turtles all the way down. In this presentation, Charles will show the layers and layers of analytic ‘turtles’ she has uncovered, beginning with choice of source column in which there is surprisingly little consensus!
Come for pizza, and stay for a lively discussion about the many turtle facets of analytical choice.
