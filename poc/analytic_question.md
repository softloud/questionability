What is the network of ways that variables were decomposed by many analysts to answer the nestling question by:

- nodes: 
  - shaped by:
    - source columns
    - (transformtions on source columns, not in first pass)
    - outcome distributions
  - sized by: number of studies that used that variable

- edges by studies:
  - from source: source column or transformation
  - to outcome: transformation or outcome
  - between source: used in the same study
